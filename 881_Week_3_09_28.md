### Summary
Those two papers are investigating the relationship between TOTAL-C/LDL-C levels and CHD risk. Recall the age of publication, medical scholars planned to test the hypothesis that cholesterol in food -> cholesterol in blood -> coronary heart disease risk. The research was solid and 3806 volunteers were engaged. The experiments suggested the reduction of TOTAL-C and LDL-C levels could lead to the reduction of CHD incidence.

### Reflection
It was controversial that the total mortality incidence in the treatment group was larger than the placebo group, but not at a significant level. It was the point that was attacked by the public. It reminds me that every experiment could come with randomness.
