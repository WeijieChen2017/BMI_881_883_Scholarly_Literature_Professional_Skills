### Summary
The authors presented a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method for visualizing data, especially in 2d/3d data. It is claimed that the Euclidian distance can be replaced with pairwise similarity and the high dimension manifold in low data space can be flattened and visualized. However, this method is also limited by the curse of dimension, so the performance in very high dimensions is also not ideal.

### Reflection
It can be treated as prior knowledge or pattern that the data is in a high dimensional manifold. Based on that, we can use t-SNE to do the data visualization. So if we have some prior knowledge about the high dimensional dataset, we can imitate the derivation process to reduce the dimension.

### Inspiration
t-SNE is powerful in some animal action pattern analysis, maybe it is indicated that those type of dataset is not of so high dimension and we still need a way to represent super high dimension.
