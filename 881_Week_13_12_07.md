### Summary
That topic is about unconscious bias. Women made great progress in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Medicine) and they can acquire more roles in policymaking, including funding distribution. 

### Reflection
I saw something like "Women in Big Data" in UW-Madison, this is a step for women to enter the informatics area. I believe things are getting better.

### Inspiration
I saw a report on WFH. It says women will engage more in housework, so more women scientists leave the scientific area. I believe more efforts are needed to explore WFH influence.
