Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) can measure the identical metabolic intensity of tissues, while the attenuation map is provided by synthetic CT (sCT) for attenuation corrections. 

Due to the variations in scanning time, two modalities are unregistered in certain regions, as the liver-lung boundary is shifted because of respiration. A mismatch between PET images and the attenuation map may lead to incorrect quantity and diagnosis.

Hence, numerous protocols have been implemented to restore the distortion. Previous work did not address the whole body registration. 

Here, a state-of-the-art image translation model based on vision transformation is proposed to synthesize pseudo-sCT from PET and to register real sCT to pseudo-sCT for more accurate boundaries.

This elegant pipeline can combine into the PET/CT scanners and generate real-time motion-free PET images.
