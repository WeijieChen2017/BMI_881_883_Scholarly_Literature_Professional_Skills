### Summary
One paper is a review on deep learning in biology and medicine but in 2018. 
Another paper is applying the version control idea to manuscript writing.

### Reflection
The deep learning review in 2018 maybe a little bit expired at the latest state-of-the-art.
The Manubot is an intuitive idea. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0798.pdf] provides the DataHub to manage database using Github idea. The Datahub paper talked about how to restore the desired version from the Undirected Acyclic Graph (UAG). But they did develop a very thoughtful platform for researchers.

### Inspiration
Deep learning is not only about face recognition something, but a tool to solve real-life problems. A program about experimental design [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978] and a robot automatically repeating chemical experiments [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2442-2] are also very promising and productive.
