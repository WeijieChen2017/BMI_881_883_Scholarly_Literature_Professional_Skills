### Summary
The author group developed a software named UpSet. This started with the way of aggregating data using the Combination Matrix (Venn diagram), presenting a very convenient way to organize data. After that, techniques to adjust scalability and elegantly visualize results. A low saturation color palette brings comfort. 

### Reflection
There is a visualization tool named Tableau. That tool is commercialized well and cultivates young users well. That tool focuses more on styles and a variety of impressions. This tool may work with statisticians better.

### Inspiration
This tool is great and is it popular or just a lab publication?
