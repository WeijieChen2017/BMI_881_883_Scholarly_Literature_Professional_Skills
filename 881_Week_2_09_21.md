### Summary
This article demonstrated the story that the doctor used math, instead of imagination to find out the true source of the disease. First, he denoted every death on the map, we can treat it as the data collection step. Secondly, he observed and raised one hypothesis. Then he made a step further that closed the pump, and the reality supported the hypothesis. After the closure, the number of death decreased. He extracted the knowns from the unknowns, which we can call it science.

### Reflection
We can summarize the story that data-hypothesis-experiments. In data science, the most time-consuming step is data collection and cleaning. Sometimes, after we collect data and observe, the true hidden principle will show even in a simple model.
