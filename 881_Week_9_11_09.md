### Summary
This paper collected attention to the database itself in observational studies. The authors compare 53 data pairs and 2 popular study designs (cohort studies and self-controlled case series) across 10 observational databases. When they held different study designs, the influence would range from significantly positive to significantly negative. So they raised the concern that data sources may affect results.

### Reflections
I hear one story that if we let 1024 people guess head/tail coin games 10 times, then we absolutely can select one super-lucky person. This may occur in the experiments. Cross-validation is one possible solution. 

### Inspirations
Could we design some method new to moderate the influence from selected dataset?
