### Summary
This article demonstrated the prediction model of nonmelanoma skin cancer from non-imaging information and sequential medical records. It is tricky and innovative (to me) that they created the "record matrices" and used convolutional neural networks. Their results were competitive.

### Reflection
The work is solid, from data collection, results analysis, article writing, etc. But the interesting point is "record matrices". In discussion, they compared it to the logistic regression model, artificial neural networks, XGboost classification tree, and out-preform them. I read some work about transform voice into Fourier spectrum and use CNN to analyze it.
It looks fancy but I still think it could be replaced.

### Inspiration
Did they use 1d or 2d convolution? Is there any information loss?
How about using some other sequence-specific models to deal with this type of data? Like Recursive NN / Long Short Term Memory / Transformer in Natural Language Process (NLP)?
