### Summary
This article proposed a method that can isolate covariates inside an investigation of the causal effect. As we know, it is unreal and unethical to force one of the groups to do negative "treatment". When scientists want to prove the factor A can lead to event B, it is clever to bring perpendicularity for the covariates set C. They mathematically proved their theorem and show several applications above this. This can provide excellent tools in observational studies.

### Reflection
When I read some research on causal inference using statistical data, I always wonder how can they remove the influence of hidden factors. This article points out one method, that's very brilliant.

### Inspiration
Can they handle two or a set of covariates?
Is this method popular applied and what's the improved version of this?
