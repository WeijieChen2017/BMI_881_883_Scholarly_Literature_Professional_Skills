## This is in relation to the paper on predicting nonmelanoma skin cancer, Wang et al. (2019).

#### 1. If a test has sensitivity = 80% and specificity 80% and the prevalence of the disease is 9/100,000, what is the positive predictive value (aka “precision”) of the test?

PPV = (sensitivity x prevalence) / (sensitivity x prevalence + (1-specificity) x (1-prevalence)) = (0.8*9e-5) / ( 0.8*9e-5 + 0.2*(1-9e-5) ) = 0.00035990282 = 3.6e-4

#### 2. Suppose sensitivity = specificity. What would they have to be to achieve positive predictive value = 50% when prevalence is 9/100,000?

#### 3. Comment on these results in relation to the precision values provided in Table 2 of Wang et al. (2019).
