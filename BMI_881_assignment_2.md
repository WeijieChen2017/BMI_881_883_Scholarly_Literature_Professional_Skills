## This is in relation to the paper on predicting nonmelanoma skin cancer, Wang et al. (2019).

#### 1. If a test has sensitivity = 80% and specificity 80% and the prevalence of the disease is 9/100,000, what is the positive predictive value (aka “precision”) of the test?
```math
PPV = \frac{sensitivity x prevalence}{sensitivity x prevalence + (1-specificity) x (1-prevalence)}
```

#### 2. Suppose sensitivity = specificity. What would they have to be to achieve positive predictive value = 50% when prevalence is 9/100,000?

#### 3. Comment on these results in relation to the precision values provided in Table 2 of Wang et al. (2019).
