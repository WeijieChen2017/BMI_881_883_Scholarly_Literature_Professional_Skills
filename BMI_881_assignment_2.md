### This is in relation to the paper on predicting nonmelanoma skin cancer, Wang et al. (2019).

1. If a test has sensitivity = 80% and specificity 80% and the prevalence of the disease is 9/100,000, what is the positive predictive value (aka “precision”) of the test?

2. Suppose sensitivity = specificity. What would they have to be to achieve positive predictive value = 50% when prevalence is 9/100,000?

3. Comment on these results in relation to the precision values provided in Table 2 of Wang et al. (2019).

### Answer

1. As we know, PPV = \\( \frac{sensitivity x prevalence}{sensitivity x prevalence + (1-specificity) x (1-prevalence)} \\)

2. This is a test answer. \\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 \\]

3. This is a test answer
