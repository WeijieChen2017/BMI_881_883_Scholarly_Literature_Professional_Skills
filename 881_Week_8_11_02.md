### Summary
This article proposed a method that can isolate covariates inside an investigation of the causal effect. As we know, it is unreal and unethical to force one of the groups to do negative "treatment". When scientists want to prove the factor A can lead to event B, it is clever to bring perpendicularity for the covariates set C. They mathematically proved their theorem and show several applications above this. This can provide excellent tools in observational studies.

### Reflection
When I read some research on causal inference using statistical data, I always wonder how can they remove the influence of hidden factors. This article points out one method, that's very brilliant.

### Inspiration
Can they handle two or a set of covariates?
Is this method popular applied and what's the improved version of this?


## Summary
This is a review of causal inference, including three types of causal queries, queries about the effects of potential interventions, queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, and queries about direct and indirect effects. The structural causal model is also emphasized. 

## Reflection
About if the data can show principles, there are always arguments. Correlation does not imply causation. This is the sentence. However, the causal inference may point out the direction to exploit data in a more efficient way.

## Inspiration
Is there any usage to use causal inference in diagnosis report generation? Like the area of cancer -> malignant / benign?
