### Summary
This article promotes the usage of graphics instead of tables. Previous literature claimed that tables were best suited for precious information and graphs were better for trends and comparisons. Conversely, authors would argue that graphs require more effort but reward more. And authors listed seven examples to show how to translate tables to graphs with a faster and more accurate understanding for readers. Also, the authors raised several goals and principles.

 - Comparisons outweigh absolute numbers.
 - It is useful to create multiple simple plots rather than crowding information together in one single plot.
 - Baselines provoke focusing comparisons.
 - It is recommended to keep visuals simple and label data directly if possible.
 - The zen of data displays
   - Figure out the key comparisons of interest
   - Exhibit small individual plots with comparisons
   - Assemble them to serve the main purpose

### Reactions

In illustrations of deep learning, experimental results and trends of the training progress are usually displayed in graphs. But the comparisons are tabular. It confirms the observation of this article. I believe the methods of conversions mentioned in the article are helpful.

### Inspirations

1. The exploration stops before the color and shape. [Choosing color palettes for scientific figures](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rth2.12308)
2. The super large dataset may be suitable for tables
3. Subconsciously, tables are more formal and are the preferred way to save data, like in the appendix.
