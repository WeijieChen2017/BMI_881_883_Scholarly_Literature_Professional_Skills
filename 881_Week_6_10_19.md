### Summary
This discussion is about whether it is recommended for women in their forties to do regular mammography. The balance here is about breast cancer and radiation. In short, the potential benefit of mammography may be to decrease the mortality rate or harm, and the risk of screening may include financial cost, radiation, and whether mammography truly can help. The first commentary used observational data to prove it, but the short response thought the statistical significance is not large enough. And the author of the commentary replied to insist on the point.

### Reflection
The "friendly" discussion is new to me. It is really hard to analyze massive and vague data to find supportive evidence. And meanwhile, the cost and radiation of screening are also decreasing. I think a data-driven model for every specific patient may be accurate and thoughtful rather than a general conclusion. 

### Inspiration
Is it possible to train a model to predict? Like insurance fees for drivers, safe patients may have a longer gap between two screenings, but some specific symptoms or secondary tests (like the level of hormone) could be a determinator for the next screen.
