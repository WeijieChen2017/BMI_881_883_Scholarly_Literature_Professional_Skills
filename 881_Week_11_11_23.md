### Summary
The authors provide a new lineup protocol to replace convention statistical tests. This can perform better while the effect size is large. 

### Reflection
I remember the T-test is effective only when the population size is not large. So it is glad to see a new statistical tool.

### Inspiration
The statistical tool is regularly used in my results analysis. I intend to compare whether my results are better than the baseline. Sometimes no significant difference can be hard to interpret.
